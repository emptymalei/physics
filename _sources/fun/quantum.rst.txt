.. admonition:: Why Rutherford was wrong about the atom model?

   A Rutherford atom model is the combination of protons and electrons to give us a neutral nucleus.

   Question 1: What is the energy of the electron if we confine it inside the nucleus? Consider only the kinetic energy due to uncertainty principle is enough to construct a contradiction.

   Question 2: From the point of view of nuclear magnetic moment, the electron magnetic moment is way to large. Measurement tells us that nuclei usually have nuclear magnetic moment :math:`-3\mu_N` to :math:`10\mu_N` where :math:`\mu_N=e\hbar/2m_p` and :math:`m_p` is the mass of proton.

   Hint: The magnetic moment is of the magnitude :math:`e\hbar/2m_x`.
