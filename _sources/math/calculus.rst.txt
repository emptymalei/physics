Differential of Functions

Integrals
--------------

Sometimes a integral on Real plane can be very hard, one of the techniques is to work on Complex plane and use contour integral.

1. Contours: use Ghost Contours so that we don't need to calculate these complicated integrals.
2. Branch Cut: cuts are needed if we have got branch points on the complex plane.
3. Residue Theorem: we can write down the integral by calculating the residue of the integrand,

   .. math::
      \int_C f(z) \mathrm dz = 2\pi i \sum_j \text{Residue}(f(z_j)),

   where :math:`z_j` are the poles.
