I alway believe that making things open to everyone is one of the most powerful things that drive the world forward. So I DO think open source and open data, even open education are reforming the world.

This was a notebook for myself when I was studying at Fudan University. At that time, I learned how to use LaTeX and I was so excited. So I thought I should start writing something using LaTeX since it's so beautiful. Well, the bad thing is, I just randomly wrote down my notes on some specific topics.

I was so greedy back then. Then I tried to build up my own framework of physics by writing notes here. It never did the work by the way. Then I realized a framework should be somethng organized much better than this one. (I should draw a map of physics.)

Though these notes didn't help me building up my framework of phyiscs, I learned an important lesson. A physicist should build up his/her own style: the way to think, the way to solve problems, the way to check answers, the way to write, etc.

Anyway, I got frastrated and gave up the effort to utilize it as a framework-building thing. However I won't just dump these notes. As I have more and more to add, I think I'll just let it be my notebook, which, of course, is open source and accessible to everyone.

Yes. Use the source. Keep the source open.
